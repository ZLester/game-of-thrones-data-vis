        "150": "Why do you care what I want from him?",
        "151": "Because you've slandered me to Father before.",
        "152": "Slandered? When?",
        "153": "You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.",

        "208": "Who are you?",
        "209": "I was in the battle at Blackwater.",

        "248": "You cannot turn Stannis against her.",
        "249": "Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.",
        "25": "Crow!",
        "250": "You could try.",
        "251": "If you fail, they will burn you.",

        "260": "I will gather your bones in a little sack",
        "261": "and let your widow wear them around her neck.",
        "262": "We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.",
        "263": "There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.",

        "34": "Got no fathers to slap them when they're foul.",
        "340": "And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.",

        "365": "and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange.",
        "366": "But it's not coming back.",
        "367": "The captain's tired of risking his life",
        "368": "so King's Landing lords and ladies",

        "375": "What about that one there?",
        "376": "That one? It's going to Volantis.",
        "377": "Why?",
        "378": "Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.",
        "379": "That's not how the game works.",
        "38": "If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day.",
        "380": "You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer.",
        "381": "You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.",
        "382": "Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?",
        "383": "Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.",
        "384": "Lovely day for it.",
        "385": "Watching the ships.",
        "386": "Lord Baelish.",
        "387": "Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?",
        "388": "I saw your mother not long ago.",

        "393": "You said King's Landing was your home.",
        "394": "You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason.",
        "395": "If you were to tell just one person...",
        "396": "I won't tell anyone.",
        "397": "How do I know?",
        "398": "Because I'm a terrible liar.",
        "399": "You said so yourself.",
        "4": "Tarly, look at me.",
        "40": "I smell a crow.",
        "400": "Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.",
        "401": "I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.",
        "402": "When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me.",
        "403": "But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.",
        "404": "You're her handmaiden?",
