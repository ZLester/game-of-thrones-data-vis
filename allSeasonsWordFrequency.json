      "520": "Enough!",
      "521": "He tells me one thing, she tells me another.",
      "522": "Seven hells! What am I to make of this?",
      "523": "- Where's your other daughter, Ned? - In bed, asleep.",
      "524": "She's not.",

      "543": "And what of the direwolf?",
      "544": "What of the beast that savaged your son?",
      "545": "I'd forgot the damned wolf.",
      "546": "We found no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace.",
      "547": "No? So be it.",
      "548": "We have another wolf.",
      "549": "As you will.",

      "553": "No, no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone!",
      "554": "- She's good! - Lady wasn't there!",

      "533": "And what about you, my lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?",
      "534": "Do Dornish girls count?",
      "535": "So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves",
      "536": "and bring them here as eager recruits?",
      "537": "Aye.",
      "538": "But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.",
      "539": "Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed.",
      "540": "Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.",
      "541": "They have a better chance finding feed than glory.",
      "542": "The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?",
      "543": "Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?",
      "544": "You don't have enough men to be an army",
      "545": "and, aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.",
      "546": "I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell",
      "547": "when you're back in King's Landing.",
      "548": "It's something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there,",
      "549": "enjoying your brothels.",
      "550": "Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall.",
      "551": "Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,",
      "552": "might be sickness,",
      "553": "might just be the cold.",
      "554": "They die in pain.",
      "555": "And they do it...",
      "556": "so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.",
      "557": "Do you think I'm plump?",
      "558": "- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen? - Call me what you like.",
      "559": "I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.",
      "560": "I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.",
      "561": "I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.",
      "562": "You know, my brother once told me...",
      "563": "that nothing someone says before the word \"but\" really counts.",
      "564": "But...",
      "565": "I don't believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers",
      "566": "are lurking beyond the Wall.",
      "567": "I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings",
      "568": "is that when that wall went up, our ancestors happened",
      "569": "to live on the right side of it.",
      "570": "You're right.",
      "571": "The wildlings are no different from us.",
      "572": "A little rougher maybe.",
      "573": "But they're made of meat and bone.",
      "574": "I know how to track them and I know how to kill them.",
      "575": "It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights.",
      "576": "You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.",
      "577": "Are you going below?",
      "578": "- Keep well, keep warm. - Enjoy the capital, brother.",
      "579": "Oh, I always do.",
      "580": "I think he's starting to like me.",
      "581": "- \"Going below\"? - Aye.",
      "582": "Into the tunnel and out the other side.",
      "583": "He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.",
      "584": "So... you're heading down to King's Landing too.",
      "585": "Aye, day after tomorrow.",
      "586": "I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.",
      "587": "Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.",
      "588": "I, er...",
      "589": "I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.",
      "590": "Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns.",
      "591": "No one turns away a Lannister.",
      "592": "Yes, Khaleesi.",
      "593": "Oh, what are you doing?",
      "594": "When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?",
      "595": "You change, Khaleesi.",
      "596": "It's a blessing from the Great Stallion",
      "597": "For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing,",
      "598": "easier to handle.",
      "599": "It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.",
      "600": "But a man in full plate...",
      "601": "...the arakh won't get through the steel.",

      "606": "Armour make a man, erm...",
      "607": "Slow.",
      "608": "- Slow. - It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.",
      "609": "My father taught me how to fight.",
      "610": "He taught me that speed defeats size.",
      "611": "I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.",
      "612": "He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.",
      "613": "And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?",
      "614": "He still is.",

      "621": "Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks.",
      "622": "Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?",
      "623": "Dog then. I have seen many dogs.",
      "624": "I don't think she wants to eat dog.",
      "625": "The khaleesi have baby inside her.",
      "626": "It is true. She does not bleed for two moons.",
      "627": "Her belly start to swell.",
      "628": "A blessing from the Great Stallion.",
      "629": "She does not want to eat horse.",
      "630": "I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper.",
      "631": "I need to ride to Qohor.",
      "632": "Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.",
      "633": "Don't worry. I'll catch you.",
      "634": "The horde's easy to find.",
      "635": "Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target.",
      "636": "Except for you. You move too much.",
      "637": "I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.",
      "638": "How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?",
      "639": "Eight. No, nine.",
      "640": "All of them brief?",
      "641": "They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.",
      "642": "This summer has lasted nine.",
      "643": "But reports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter.",
      "644": "The Starks are always right eventually -",

      "648": "We've been capturing wildlings, more every month.",
      "649": "They're fleeing south.",
      "650": "The ones who flee... say they've seen the white walkers.",
      "651": "Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.",
      "652": "One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions.",
      "653": "He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.",
      "654": "The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm",
      "655": "and what lies beyond.",
      "656": "And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men.",
      "657": "There are less than a thousand of us now.",
      "658": "We can't man the other castles on the Wall.",
      "659": "We can't properly patrol the wilderness.",
      "660": "We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.",
      "661": "Your sister sits by the side of the king.",
      "662": "Tell her... we need help.",
      "663": "When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.",
      "664": "It's a boy.",
      "665": "How do you know?",
      "666": "I know.",
      "667": "I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.",
      "668": "It's either me or this cold,",
      "669": "and it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.",
      "670": "Will you stop at Winterfell on your way south?",
      "671": "I expect I will.",
      "672": "Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.",
      "673": "If you see my brother Bran,",
      "674": "tell him I miss him.",
      "675": "Tell him I'd visit if I could.",
      "676": "Of course.",
      "677": "He'll never walk again.",
      "678": "If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple.",
      "679": "You take care, Snow.",
      "680": "Farewell, my lord.",
      "681": "You are late, boy.",
      "682": "Tomorrow you will be here at midday.",
      "683": "Who are you?",
      "684": "Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.",
      "685": "Tomorrow you will catch it.",
      "686": "Now pick it up.",
      "687": "That is not the way, boy.",
      "688": "It is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it.",
      "689": "- It's too heavy. - It is heavy as it needs to be",
      "690": "to make you strong.",
      "691": "Just so.",
      "692": "One hand is all that is needed.",
      "693": "Now you are standing all wrong.",
      "694": "Turn your body sideface.",
      "695": "Yes.",
      "696": "So.",
      "697": "You are skinny. That is good.",
      "698": "The target is smaller.",
      "699": "Now the grip - let me see.",
      "700": "Yes.",
      "701": "The grip must be delicate.",
      "702": "What if I drop it?",
      "703": "The steel must be part of your arm.",
      "704": "Can you drop part of your arm? No.",
      "705": "Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos.",
      "706": "He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.",
      "707": "I'm a girl.",
      "708": "Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.",
      "709": "That is the grip.",
      "710": "You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...",
      "711": "A needle.",
      "712": "Ahhh.",
      "713": "Just so.",
      "714": "Now we will begin the dance.",
      "715": "Remember, child,",

      "719": "the water dance.",

      "522": "For three chickens, I should hope so.",
      "523": "It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.",
      "524": "But she was good to me.",
      "525": "She kissed me afterwards and...",

      "530": "For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.",
      "531": "Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.",
      "532": "Not quite.",
      "533": "First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.",
      "534": "The girl was a whore, you see.",

      "538": "my father brought in my wife",

      "542": "He brought me into the barracks and made me watch.",
      "543": "By the end, she had so much silver",
      "544": "that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.",
      "545": "I would have killed the man who did that to me.",
